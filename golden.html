<p>
The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular and recognizable dog breeds in the world.
Originally bred in Scotland in the mid-19th century, Golden Retrievers were developed to retrieve
game during hunting. They are known for their gentle temperament, intelligence, and eagerness to
please, making them highly trainable and reliable companions.
</p>
<p>
Golden Retrievers are medium to large-sized dogs with a dense, water-repellent coat that is
usually golden or cream-colored. Friendly with children and other pets, they are often considered
the “ultimate family dog.” They require regular exercise and thrive in active households.
