<p>
The German Shepherd is a breed of working dog developed in Germany in the late 19th century.
They are widely recognized for their intelligence, courage, and versatility. German Shepherds
are used in police and military roles, as search-and-rescue dogs, and as service dogs. Their
loyalty and protective nature make them excellent guardians and companions.
</p>
<p>
Known for their strong build and alert demeanor, German Shepherds require both physical and
mental stimulation. They are highly trainable and excel in obedience, agility, and herding.
When raised in a loving home, they are affectionate family members who bond closely with their owners.
