<p>
The Siberian Husky is a medium-sized working dog bred by the Chukchi people of Siberia as a
sled dog. They are known for their striking appearance, including thick fur, erect triangular ears,
and piercing blue or multicolored eyes. Huskies are energetic, playful, and adventurous, making
them ideal companions for active owners.
</p>
<p>
Huskies are intelligent but often independent, requiring patient training and lots of exercise.
They are social dogs that thrive in packs, which makes them great for families with multiple pets.
With their beauty, stamina, and lively personality, Siberian Huskies remain one of the most iconic
and admired breeds worldwide.
