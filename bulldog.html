The Bulldog, often called the English Bulldog, is a medium-sized breed known for its muscular build,
wrinkled face, and lovable personality. Originally bred in England for bull-baiting, they have
since become gentle, affectionate pets adored worldwide. Bulldogs are calm and devoted, preferring
a relaxed lifestyle with plenty of naps.

Despite their tough appearance, Bulldogs are friendly and affectionate, especially toward children.
They adapt well to apartment living and do not require excessive exercise. Their gentle nature
makes them excellent companions for families looking for a loyal, loving dog.
